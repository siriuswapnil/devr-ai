# API Integrator VSCode Extension

Quickly integrate third-party APIs like Stripe and Novu into your codebase with best practices, onboarding, and interactive setup.

Our project solved the problem by bringing API integration into the coding flow itself.

Instead of forcing developers to read external docs, manually install SDKs, set up environment variables, and write boilerplate service code, our VSCode extension automated the entire process.

Developers could now
Browse supported APIs inside their editor. Choose specific endpoints they wanted to use.

Instantly insert ready-to-use, best-practice function calls at the exact spot they needed, complete with auto-imports and safe environment setup.

By doing this, we eliminated the biggest friction points — context switching, boilerplate writing, SDK setup confusion — and helped developers move from "idea" to "working API integration" in a fraction of the time.
